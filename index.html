<h2>Berlin Umsonst</h2>

<div>

Hy there,

my name is N.Lesemann, first and for most, I would like to thank you for using Berlin umsonst.<br>
And I would also like to inform you as well that the app does not analyze or collect any data from its users.<br>
Should this change in the future, I will make sure to inform you.

Should you have any matters you'd like to discuss concerning the app, 
please feel free to contact me at berlin.umsonst@gmail.com. 
<br><br>
Hope you enjoy it and keep safe.
</div>
